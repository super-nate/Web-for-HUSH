# Web-for-HUSH
A web application for the HUSHï¼ŒHUSH is a stealthy Arduino-based device, camouflaged as a black box, that wirelessly and passively sniffs, decrypts, logs and reports back (over GSM) all keystrokes from any Microsoft wireless keyboard in the vicinity.

We suppose it is product that can be use by managers to monitor the behavior of their employees to protect the company from sensitive data disclousure.

The website will receive the message sent by the HUSH device, and display the messege on the screen realtime. What's more, we will process the message, if we find some sensitive words, the item in the screen will become red to alert to monitor, and an alert email will be sent to monitor.

In addition, we also offer the checking function, so that the monitor can check the previous message records.
